<p>I've been doing some pretty exciting things recently with website performance. I always disliked doing IT work in the past, but the challenge of setting a server up to be able to withstand crushing traffic is now quite intriguing to me.</p>
<p>To wit, here's a funny moment from a recent experiment. I was using incrond to run a script to minify some JavaScript whenever Drupal created a new JS file. Unfortunately, my script also created a new JS file (a backup, unminified copy,) and the protection I put into place wasn't quite working correctly. I think the image below speaks for itself.</p>
