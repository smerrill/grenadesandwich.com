<p>I work for <a href="http://treehouseagency.com/">Tree House Agency</a> here in NYC, and we gave out custom-printed flip minos (one per company)&nbsp;to our corporate partners as Christmas gifts.&nbsp;</p><p>Each of the employees also got one. Our CEO <a href="http://treehouseagency.com/users/michael-caccavano">Michael Caccavano</a> played Santa and left them in the NYC&nbsp;office for us to pick up this last Thursday, and I&nbsp;couldn't resist getting a shot of it with Photo Booth.</p><p>Gotta love it - yet another perk of working with Tree House.</p>
