<p>Welcome to the new (and completely empty) Grenade Sandwich. My name is Steven Merrill, a classical singer and technologist, and I'll be your host.</p>
<!-- break -->
<p>The title of this site comes from a season finale of The Shield, and I&nbsp;think you'll understand what I'm talking about if you're a fan of the show.</p>

<p>This site will serve as a place where I&nbsp;can write about a number of different things other than my technical writings on Drupal, which I&nbsp;publish both at cascadingstyle.net and treehouseagency.com, and technology tips for classical singers, which will soon be up on a new web property.</p><div style="page-break-after: always;"><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>One of my 2009 resolutions is to consume less (food, media, etc.) and produce more and this site'll be one part of that strategy.</p>

<p>Now for just a couple technical bits - the new site's running Drupal (of course.)&nbsp;It uses a custom theme I&nbsp;developed off of a CSS&nbsp;template that I&nbsp;got by subscribing to Templatica.com. Check it out - it's definitely worth the low yearly subscription cost of $24, especially since they've already added one additional template since I&nbsp;signed up.</p>

<p>There's all the other standard good Drupal bits in here, too - Mollom for spam prevention, Twitter module for showing you my tweets, Views, CCK, and a little Amazon integration which I'll use more heavily on my next project.</p>
