Let's say you have upgraded to OS X Lion and you want to set it up to do web development. (I'll assume that you want to do Drupal web development, but this will get you set up for any LAMP application.) There will be a couple of tweaks you'll want to make to get your Lion purring.

In short, here's what you will need to do:

1. Install XCode (or gcc)
2. Install Homebrew
3. Brew Some Software
4. Tune Apache
